          Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by
          Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. The software has become the industry
          standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a
          whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark,
          leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image",
          "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages
          such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple
          layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models
          including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses
          its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In
          addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit
          or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path
          for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can
          be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed
          independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or
          enhanced features.

          Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software
          application developed by Adobe Systems and published as part of the
          Adobe Creative Cloud licensing program. First launched in 2003, Adobe
          Premiere Pro is a successor of Adobe Premiere (first launched in
          1991). It is geared towards professional video editing, while its
          sibling, Adobe Premiere Elements, targets the consumer market.

          <br />

          <br />

          Premiere Pro supports high resolution video editing at up to 10,240 ×
          8,192 resolution, at up to 32-bits per channel color, in both RGB and
          YUV. Audio sample-level editing, VST audio plug-in support, and 5.1
          surround sound mixing are available. Premiere Pro's plug-in
          architecture enables it to import and export formats beyond those
          supported by QuickTime or DirectShow, supporting a wide variety of
          video and audio file formats and codecs on both MacOS and Windows.
          When used with CineForm's Neo line of plug-ins, it supports 3D editing
          with the ability to view 3D material using 2D monitors, while making
          individual left and right eye adjustments. Premiere Pro can be used
          for all common video editing tasks necessary for producing
          broadcast-quality, high-definition video. It can be used to import
          video, audio and graphics, and is used to create new, edited versions
          of video which can be exported to the medium and format necessary for
          distribution. When creating videos using Premiere Pro, various video
          and still images can be edited together. Titles can be added to
          videos, and filters can be applied along with other effects.

          Adobe Lightroom (officially Adobe Photoshop Lightroom) is a family of
          image organization and image manipulation software developed by Adobe
          Systems for Windows, macOS, iOS and Android It allows
          importing/saving, viewing, organizing, tagging, editing, and sharing
          large numbers of digital images.[4] Unlike Photoshop, Lightroom's
          edits are always non-destructive by keeping the original image and the
          edits applied to it saved separately. Despite sharing its name with
          Adobe Photoshop, it cannot perform many Photoshop functions such as
          doctoring (adding, removing or altering the appearance of individual
          image items), rendering text or 3D objects on images, or modifying
          individual video frames. Lightroom is not a file manager like Adobe
          Bridge. It cannot operate on files unless they are imported into its
          database first, and only in recognized image formats.

          post-production process of film making, video games , television
          production and Motion Graphics. Among other things, After Effects can
          be used for keying, tracking, compositing, and animation. It also
          functions as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor, and media
          transcoder. In 2019, the program won an Academy Award for scientific
          and technical achievement.
