          Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by
          Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. The software has become the industry
          standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a
          whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark,
          leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image",
          "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages
          such use. Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple
          layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models
          including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone. Photoshop uses
          its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In
          addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit
          or render text and vector graphics (especially through clipping path
          for the latter), as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can
          be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed
          independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or
          enhanced features.

          Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software
          application developed by Adobe Systems and published as part of the
          Adobe Creative Cloud licensing program. First launched in 2003, Adobe
          Premiere Pro is a successor of Adobe Premiere (first launched in
          1991). It is geared towards professional video editing, while its
          sibling, Adobe Premiere Elements, targets the consumer market.

          Premiere Pro supports high resolution video editing at up
          to 10,240 × 8,192 resolution, at up to 32-bits per channel color,
          in both RGB and YUV. Audio sample-level editing, VST audio plug-in
          support, and 5.1 surround sound mixing are available. Premiere Pro's
          plug-in architecture enables it to import and export formats beyond
          those supported by QuickTime or DirectShow, supporting a wide variety
          of video and audio file formats and codecs on both MacOS and Windows.
          When used with CineForm's Neo line of plug-ins, it supports 3D editing
          with the ability to view 3D material using 2D monitors, while making
          individual left and right eye adjustments. Premiere Pro can be used
          for all common video editing tasks necessary for producing
          broadcast-quality, high-definition video. It can be used to import
          video, audio and graphics, and is used to create new, edited versions
          of video which can be exported to the medium and format necessary for
          distribution. When creating videos using Premiere Pro, various video
          and still images can be edited together. Titles can be added to
          videos, and filters can be applied along with other effects.

          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
          not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
          the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
          Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
