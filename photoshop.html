        <p>
          Layers are what they say there are, Layers. Layers are very useful in
          Photoshop. Each layer is an individual which means you can edit it
          without editing any of the other layers.
          <br />
          CreateNew Layer. To create a new layer go into 'Layer - New - Layer'
          or by click the box with folded conner at the bottom right hand conner
          of the window.
          <br />

          - LockingLayers. Layers can be locked which means that they can't be
          edited until you unlock it. There are Three different types of Locks.

          <br />
          - LockTransparentPixels - This will make the pixels you erase black
          instead of getting rid of them.
          <br />
          - LockImagePixels - This will mean you can't change the pixels into
          anything such as colouring it in.

          <br />
          - LockPosition - This will mean you are not able to move the image.

          <br />
          - The last one will lock everything which mean you will not be able to
          edit it at all.

          <br />
          <br />
          <b>HidingLayer.</b> Layer can be hid by press the 'Eye' icon next to
          the layer. Click it again and the layer will be visible again.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>LayerStyle.</b> This are some setting that can be changes to make
          the layer look different. To open the layer style window just double
          click the layer which will open a new window. Some things you can do
          are:
          <br />
          <br />
          - Opacity - Change the opacity of the layer. - Stroke - Put an outline
          on the layer. - InnerShadow - Puts a shadow inside the layer which
          give it an effect of it is going inside.
          <br />
          - InnerGlow - Put a glow on the inside. <br />
          - ColorOverlay - Put a colour on top of the layer.<br />
          - GradientOverlay - Put a gradient on top of the layer.<br />
          - GradientOverlay - Put a gradient on top of the layer.<br />
          - PatternOverlay - Put a pattern on top of the layer.<br />
          - OuterGlow - Put a glow outside the layer.<br />
          - DropShadow - Put a shadow underneath the layer which give the effect
          of it floating.
          <br />

          <b>Groups. </b>Groups are used to organise your layer. You can create
          a group by clicking on the folder button at the button right hand
          conner of the window.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Guides.</b> Guides are very useful. To make a new guide go to 'View
          - New Guide'. This will bring up a new window. You can choose weather
          the guide is vertical or horizontal. Then write where it is. I
          recommend you use '%'. I suggest when you start a new project you make
          two guides, one vertical at 50% and the other horizontal at 50%.

            Filters and Image Adjustments
          </h2>

          <p>
            NOTE: For this section you will need a picture. Make sure your photo
            hasn't been edited.
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Open Photoshop.
            <br />
            2. Go to 'File - Open' or Click 'Ctrl/Cmd + O'. Then select the
            photo you have choosen.

            <br />
            <br />
            <b>ImageAdjustments.</b>
            <br />
            <b>Brightness and Contrast</b>
            1. Go to 'Image - Adjustments - Brightness/Contrast'<br />
            2. You will now see two sliders, one for the brightness and the
            other for contrast. Play around with the slider till you think your
            photo looks better
            <br />
            <b>Vibrane</b>
            1. Go to 'Image - Adjustments - Vibrance'<br />
            2. You will now see to slider, one for vibrance and the other for
            saturation. Play around with the slider till you think your photo
            looks better.
            <br />
            There are a lot of other settings you can change. If you want to
            know what they all do you should play around with them. The main
            reason you would use them is to change the colour of a picture.
            <br />
            <b>Filters.</b>
            1. Go to 'Filter - Filter Gallery'. This will open a new window. You
            might have to the zoom from '100%' to 'Fit in View'. This is located
            at the bottom left corner of the window.<br />
            2. You will have a lot of different filters so the best thing to do
            is look at all of them and pick the best one.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Creating Something!
          </h2>

          <p>
            1. You have to get a theme for your wallpaper. <br />
            2. Once you have chosen your theme you will need to get a Background
            picture which will be the main picture of the wallpaper.
            <br />

            3. Now Open photoshop and create a new project. You will have to
            make the dimensions of the document you screen size. If you don't
            know what your screen resolution is go can check by:<br />
            Windows - Start - Control Panel - Appearance and Personalization -
            Display - Adjust resolution<br />
            Mac - Apple Button - About This Mac - More Info - Displays<br />

            4. Now open your Background Picture and Logo.<br />

            5. Drag the background picture into the new document you created.
            Resize the picture and make it fit.
            <br />
            6. Rename the layer to 'Background Picture'<br />

            7. Create new guides by going into 'View - New Guide'<br />
            - Make three vertical guides at 0%, 50% and 100%<br />
            - Make three Horizontal guides at 40%, 50% and 60% 8. Now drag the
            logo in and centre it. Make sure it fits in between the 40% and 60%
            guides.<br />

            9. Select the rectangle shape and make the fill a gradient. Now
            click on the gradient which will open a new window. Bring the two
            small boxes on the left into the middle. Make the colour of the
            bottom one white. Now click on the top small box on the right. Make
            the opacity 0%. Now click on the left hand side (Top) to make a new
            small box. Make sure it is 0%. Then click 'Ok'.
            <br />
            10. Use the rectangle tool to make a rectangle shape in the
            rectangular box that the guides make.
            <br />
            11. Double click on the rectangle box layer and make the opacity
            around about 50%.
            <br />
            12. Now create a new layer and place it at the top of all the
            layers.
            <br />
            13. Select the gradient tool and select the last gradient preset.
            Change the style to radial and click and drag from the bottom of the
            document to the top. This will make a fade.
            <br />
            14. Now save two copies. One 'PSD' and the other 'PNG'. Use the
            'PNG' as your Wallpaper.
