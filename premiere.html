        <b> 1. Start Organized, Stay Organized</b> <br />
        Make your life easier down the road by keeping your work organized from
        the start. Whether working off an internal or external hard drive, start
        every project by creating a project folder. This folder will contain all
        the files related to your project, placed accordingly in the following
        subfolders:<br />
        <br />

        <!--Image-->

          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/144dc398-498e-4a9a-acb9-57b59752ddf2%2FFolderStructure.png?v=1598151610642"
          alt="folder-structure"
          class="w3-image"
          style="width:100%;max-width:500px"
        />

        <br />
        <br />

        Always knowing where your files are located will save you tons of time
        and improve your workflow efficiency, while switching to a different
        workstation will be easy with all your files in one place. Plus,
        archiving your projects in an organized fashion will facilitate coming
        back to them effortlessly in the future.

        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Creating a new project</b><br />
        First, you need to create a new project. You have to define the location
        where you want your project to be saved on your hard drive and which
        locations Adobe Premiere Pro will use for temporary files.
        <br />
        <br />

          style="width:100%;max-width:500px"
        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Importing your media files</b> <br />
        Once you have your project set up you need to import some media. You can
        import videos, audio files, images and many other types of visual
        content; Premiere Pro is pretty flexible. It is advisable to create
        folders within your project to organise all of your content so you can
        easily find what you are looking for.
        <br />
        <br />

          style="width:100%;max-width:500px"
        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Creating a new sequence</b> <br />
        A sequence is a container for your media files, a template that you can
        use to organise your clips and then export into a final video file.
        There are multiple ways to create a sequence. The easiest way is to drag
        a piece of media directly onto the 'New Item' icon. Premiere Pro will
        automatically create a new sequence whose settings match the file that
        you used to create it. You can also click onto the 'New Item' icon and
        select 'Sequence' from the context menu. You can then specify all of the
        settings for the new sequence manually before creating it.
        <br />
        <br />

          alt="new-sequence"

          style="width:100%;max-width:500px"
        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Editing your project</b> <br />
        Once you have your sequence set up you can start to drag and drop your
        media items into the timeline, cut out the best parts and arrange them
        to create your film project outline. Make sure to familiarise yourself
        with all of the great editing tools provided by Premiere Pro and I
        guarantee your editing will flow a whole lot quicker.
        <br />

        <br />

        <b>Adding video transitions</b> <br />
        Transitions are used to blend between two consecutive clips. You can
        find a large number of transitions in Premiere Pro in the Effects panel,
        anything from simple fades and dissolves to 3D wipes. Simply navigate to
        the 'Effects' panel in Premiere Pro, open up the 'Video Transitions'
        folder and drag the transition you want onto the start or the cut
        between the clips in your sequence. You can double click a transition to
        adjust its settings such as the duration or the direction.
        <br />

        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Adding video and audio effects</b> <br />
        In the Effects panel in Premiere Pro you will also find a 'Video
        Effects' folder. In here you will find large number of cool deformation,
        colour correction, styling effects inbuilt into Premiere Pro. Simply
        drag the effect onto the clip you want to apply them to. With the clip
        selected, you can tweak the effect parameter in the Effects Control
        panel.

        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Adding titles</b> <br />
        Titles are usually text elements, but can also contain icons and
        graphics, that overlay your footage. You can create titles by clicking
        on the New Item icon and then selecting 'Title' from the context menu.
        Double click the title to bring up the title editor. In the title editor
        you can then define the elements in your title. Once you created the
        title, simply drag it from the project panel anywhere into your sequence
        to place it within your edit.

          style="width:100%;max-width:500px"
        />
        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Exporting your sequence</b> <br />
        Once you are happy with your sequence, you can export it. Before you can
        export a sequence you need to place the start and end markers - you can
        do this by positioning the timeline indicator where you want, right
        clicking it and selecting 'Mark In' and 'Mark Out'. This will define the
        working area of your sequence and tell Premiere Pro which parts of the
        sequence you want to export. With your working area defined, make sure
        the sequence is selected and then select File -- Export -- Media from
        the menu. Configure your export format, codec, custom overlays and your
        target filename and then click the 'Export' button. Personally I am a
        big fan of the H.264 codec and it's created some great results without
        an overly large file size.
